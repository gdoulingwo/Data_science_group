## Required Materials ##

### Materials to Purchase

Every effort has been made to keep the tailor the materials to the topics in the course, and to avoid unneed expense. The following coursepack should be purchased by all students --

* A course pack consisting of five case studies and one supply chain simulation is available from the Harvard Business School Press. Use this link [https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/access/32129411](https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/access/32129411) to order the course pack. The course pack is delivered electronicall with an option to order a paper copy of the case studies.

These two books are popularized accounts of key topics that will be discussed in the course. These are inexpensive (especially in ebook form), relatively quick reads, that will add to your understanding of the course material.

This book is highly recommended for those who wish to apply linear optimization tools to real-world business problems. The text, now in its fifth edition, was developed by a professor at the London School of Economics, and is one of the most widely known books its kind.

All other course materials available through Hesburgh library or on-line.

### Software ##

A key objective of this course is to provide students with the skills necessary to formulate and solve problems in operations management.  This objective is facilitated if students have individual access to software tools for implementation.

* **IPython.** Many of the course topics will be illustrated with examples coded and made available in the form of [IPython notebooks](http://jckantor.github.io/ESTM60203/).
* **GLPK/MathProg.** GLPK/MathProg is provides open source implementation of AMPL, an industry standard  language for operations and decisions. This course will use a [unique, web-based implementation](http://www3.nd.edu/~jeff/mathprog/mathprog.html) to facilitate learning and subsequent applications development.

## Learning Outcomes

This module provides an overview of selected concepts in Applied Operations Research. The course is organized around a general theme of modeling and optimization for process operations, with the main attention on techniques for modeling and solving problems in process operations, managing complex systems of activities, and understanding the role of uncertainty in capital allocation and planning.

Students completing this module will be able to:

1. Formulate, model in a mathematical programming language, and compute solutions for small to medium scale applications of linear programming in process operations, including binary and integer decision variables.
2.  and solve network, transportation, and related logistics optimization problems of small to medium scale.
3. Prepare a critical path analysis for medium scale projects, identify the critical path, find earliest finish times and latest start times.
4. Analyze job shop and flow shop performance for deterministic conditions under common prioritization schedules, including FIFO, LIFO, EDD, and SDT.
5. Calculate optimal schedules for job and flow shops under deterministic constraints.
6. Formulate and solve capital allocation problem using mean/variance analysis of return and risk.
7. Calculate optimal inventories using two-stage stochastic decision models with recourse.
8. Prepare decision trees and solve for expected mean value, expected value of perfect information.
9. Analyze case studies using selected tools from Operations Research.

## Grading ##

A grade will be assigned based on in-class participation and performance on case study projects and final project. Case studies and final project will be turned for grading via the Sakai course management system.  Components grades will be on a 5-10 point scale (10-20 for the final project), totaled, and adjusted based on class participation to determine a course letter grade.
